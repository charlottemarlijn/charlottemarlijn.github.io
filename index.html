    Hi! I'm Charlotte! In the summer of 2018, I graduated from Leiden University
    with a degree in astronomy, with a specialisation in cosmology. In short,
    cosmology is the study of the history, present and future of the universe!
    All the big questions that go through everyones mind at some point, like "How
    did we come to exist?" and "What is the universe made of?" are what drove me to
    pursue a master's degree in cosmology. With courses like <i>Large Scale Structure
    and Galaxy Formation</i>, <i>Particle Physics and the Early Universe</i> and
    <i>Black Holes and Gravitational Waves</i>, my curiosity was slightly relieved.
    <br />
    During my studies, I gained a lot of <a href="research.html">research experience</a>,
    and some experience with teaching. However, instead of doing more research,
    I now want to spread my own enthusiasm for physics and astronomy to everyone else.
    Because everyone should be inspired by our cosmos!
    <br />
